# Image-classification-with-Data-augmentation

classify cats or dogs from images. It builds an image classifier using a tf.keras.Sequential model and load data using tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator

Building data input pipelines using the tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator class to efficiently work with data on disk to use with the model.
